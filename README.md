Background Information

HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading
to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using
analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data have been
largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the
approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments
woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game.

Problem Statement

You work for Alphabet Inc. which is a large Multinational Corporation. The company has
9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problems the company is facing is
around identifying the right people for promotion (only for the manager position and
below) and prepare them in time.
Currently, the process that HR is following is as follows:
● They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past
performance.
● Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for
each vertical.
● These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical. At the end of the
program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion
(only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., the
employee gets a promotion.
For the above-mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the
evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, the company
needs your help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that
they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance
along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at a
checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process. For your
review process, you will be required to compare the effectiveness of your solution with
some emerging technologies such as Neural Networks.
